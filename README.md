# Neon's Color Changing Noun

![Color chaning noun .gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/7SrmPnpz1mI2bvdmRy/giphy.gif)

This is a derivative [Noun](https://nouns.wtf/) NFT that changes color every time it is viewed.

Four pairs of images and metadata are stored on Arweave and a manifest file is utilized to make **each one have the same base URI**. Here are the Arweave URLs:
```
https://arweave.net/gU0SB5pNS5DfrfZtrP3kZSW1AyYMWdzG6JtUSYsADGM/1 // ðŸ’  Cyan
https://arweave.net/gU0SB5pNS5DfrfZtrP3kZSW1AyYMWdzG6JtUSYsADGM/2 // ðŸ’ž Fuchsia
https://arweave.net/gU0SB5pNS5DfrfZtrP3kZSW1AyYMWdzG6JtUSYsADGM/3 // ðŸ¦‹ Amber
https://arweave.net/gU0SB5pNS5DfrfZtrP3kZSW1AyYMWdzG6JtUSYsADGM/4 // ðŸŒ± Emerald
```

When the contract's `tokenURI` is queried, it uses the `block.timestamp % 4 + 1` to create a pseudo-random number between 1 and 4 then tacks that number onto the Arweave base URI and returns it. That way, just about each time `tokenURI` gets queried, it returns a different set of image and metadata.

This code is open-source. Please clone, fork, and code to your heart's content!
